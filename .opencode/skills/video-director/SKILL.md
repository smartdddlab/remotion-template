# Video Director

## Overview

Production framework that transforms video scripts into structured plans with clear instructions for all creative departments, quality checkpoints, and implementation guidance.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- User provides video script or theme description
- Need structured production plan with scenes, audio, visual design
- Require quality checkpoints and department coordination
- Converting text to professional video production framework

**Do NOT use for:**
- Live-action shooting with physical crew coordination
- Real-time editing without pre-production planning
- Simple social media clips without structured requirements

## Core Pattern

**Without Framework (Ad-hoc)**
```
Input: "Make a 60s video about quantum computing"
Process: Ad-hoc scene creation
Output: Inconsistent elements, unclear instructions, quality issues
```

**With Framework (Structured)**
```
Input: "Make a 60s video about quantum computing"
Process: Structured analysis → Department guidance → Quality checkpoints
Output: Complete production plan with clear instructions for all teams
```

## Framework Methodology

**Director's Decision Process:**
1. **Analyze Requirements** → Video type, theme, emotional tone, target audience
2. **Plan Creative Elements** → Script structure, visual style, audio approach, pacing
3. **Coordinate Departments** → Ensure consistency across script, audio, visual design
4. **Generate Production Plan** → Structured guidance for all implementation teams
5. **Set Quality Checkpoints** → Review gates at each production stage

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping framework analysis** → Inconsistent creative vision across departments
2. **Ignoring cross-stage dependencies** → Causes rework and timeline issues
3. **Bypassing quality checkpoints** → Final product quality suffers
4. **Unclear department instructions** → Implementation teams lack clear guidance
5. **Inconsistent audio-visual timing** → Scene durations don't match audio pacing
